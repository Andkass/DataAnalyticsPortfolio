## Welcome to My Portfolio!

In this portfolio you will find data science projects who many companies are constantly trying to solve nowadays. The datasetes were extracted from Kaggle's webstie and these Machine Learning's projects were created by me.

## Data Science Project

### [E-Commerce Project](https://github.com/Andkass/DataAnalyticsPortfolio/blob/main/MachineLearning_ECommerce.ipynb)

In the structure of this project, it contains the following items:
- The introduction of the company. What is the company, what do they sell, composition of the variables in your data set, etc;
- Import of libraries used on the projects;
- Import of the dataset, print the data size to get a overview;
- Exclude columns that will not be useful in the analysis and will only take up space;
- EDA analysis: checking some outliers;
- Correlation analysis between the variables;
- Plotting some graphs to get some insights;
- Encoding (feature engineering): to adjust some information shown on the dataset to make it possible to run a machine learning algorithm and also doing the featur selection;
- Forecast Model: how much the method to assess how much the model can "explain" the variable;
- Data Preparation: parameters for the variables will be displayed (x and y). Depending on the nature type of the variable (continuous or discrete), mathematical models will be defined for the same classification or regression;
- Model Training and Performance: the separation of data in test and training. Them, the Machine Learning will "tell" how good is your model to that variable. The higher the value of your forecast model, the better the analytical model;
- Conclusions: All the useful insights you could summarize in the project and what next steps can be taken to the company.

## Data Analytics Project

### [Super Market Power BI Project](https://github.com/Andkass/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/Supermarket_Sales.pbix)

The "Super Market Power BI Project" contains a dataset of a retail company and that we can draw some insights from the graphics on the dashboard:

- The main spikes in customers' shopping hours;
- Composition of the type of payment of customers (cash, card or "virtual wallet") and thus, be able to act on. Example: discount to subscribers of the virtual wallet, and thus, retain customer loyalty;
- Which products are the best sellers (and which are the least sold to be able to do a marketing action on them / increase the stock of the best sellers)
- Which cities are earning the most revenue (and why);

Below, a preview of the dashboard:
